"""Pure scoring functions for all five SKU rationalization dimensions.

Each function takes a raw measured value and returns a score 1–5.
5 = best performance, 1 = worst performance.

Thresholds are calibrated from actual Cinderhaven data percentile
distributions. For "lower is better" dimensions the scoring is inverted:
a low raw value earns a high score.

No database access, no side effects. Tests live in tests/test_scoring/.
